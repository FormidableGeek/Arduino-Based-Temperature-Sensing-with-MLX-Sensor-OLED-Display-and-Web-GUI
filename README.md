# Arduino-Based-Temperature-Sensing-with-MLX-Sensor-OLED-Display-and-Web-GUI

This project uses an mlx sensor to detect temperature of target objects,and displaying the readings to an OLED screen, supporting the use of a desktop app which connects to the thermometer using a USB cable (giving it the ability to save temperature reading to database and send it via email).
